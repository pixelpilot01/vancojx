Vancomycin Dosage Calculator

Overview
This Vancomycin Dosage Calculator is a web-based tool designed for pharmacists to quickly and accurately determine appropriate dosing regimens for vancomycin administration. It takes into account key safety parameters such as concentration limits and infusion rates to provide recommendations that align with best practices in antimicrobial stewardship.
Features

Calculates appropriate bag size, infusion time, and rate based on the input dose
Automatically adjusts recommendations for high doses to maintain safe concentration levels
Provides warnings for potentially unsafe concentrations or infusion rates
Displays infusion rates in both ml/hr and GM/hr for comprehensive understanding

Usage

Enter the prescribed vancomycin dose in milligrams (mg) in the input field.
Click the "Calculate" button to generate the dosing recommendation.
Review the output, which includes:

Recommended diluent bag size (NS or D5W)
Infusion time and rate (in ml/hr and GM/hr)
Resulting concentration (mg/ml)
Any relevant warnings



Safety Considerations

The calculator aims to maintain concentrations at or below 5 mg/ml.
Infusion rates are calculated to not exceed 1000 mg/hour to minimize the risk of red man syndrome.
For doses that would result in concentrations > 5 mg/ml in a 500ml bag, the calculator automatically recommends a 1000ml bag with adjusted infusion times.
